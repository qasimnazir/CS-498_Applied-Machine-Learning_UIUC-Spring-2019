# Homework 10: Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch
 
https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498aml/sp2019/homeworks/homework10.html

## Goal
In this homework set, you will extend from neural network with simple fully connected layers (as in Homework 8) and learn to use convolution layers, batch normailzation, and advanced features to improve the accuracy.  
The assignment must be done using PyTorch platform and GPU. Do all of your work in the provided iPython notebook.
The libraries you may need to have are in this requirements.txt file.

## Problems

- Download the Python Notebook here. Alternatively, you can access a read-only version on colab here (update 4/19: added definition of Flatten class and train function in part 0) of which you will need to make a copy.
- There are cells for you to input code, as well as text. Make sure to fill in all such cells before submission. Important information and sections are in bold.
- The report requirement is described in the notebook also. Please check the detail there.
